          <h2>Welcome back! Next on the chopping board... Noodle!</h2>
          <p>Have you ever been running late to a flight and felt a sense of relief when an airline has an army of check-in kiosks? Congrats, you're saved from the long check-in line, IF you can manage to navigate the kiosk.</p>
        </section>
  
        <section id="original">
          <h2>Original</h2>
          <img class="centered-large-image" src="./assets/annotated sketch.png" alt="Kiosk Sketch"/>
          <p>A self-service check-in kiosk is designed to help airport travelers check in for their flights, 
            print boarding passes, and generate bag tags. The interface aims to reduce long wait 
            times at airline check-in counters by allowing passengers to complete necessary tasks independently.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Touchscreen Display: Main input method for users to navigate flight check-in, baggage selection, and printing options.
              <li>Mobile QR Code Scanner: Allows passengers to scan their boarding pass from a mobile device instead of manually entering booking details.
              <li>Card Reader: Used for credit or debit payments when needed, no apple pay.
              <li>Headphone Jack: Provides accessibility options for visually impaired users who need audio guidance.
              <li>Boarding Pass Dispenser: Prints physical copies of boarding passes for passengers and receipts.
              <li>Printed Bag Tag Retrieval: Dispenses printed luggage tags that travelers attach to their checked baggage.
            </ul>
          <p>This kiosk is designed to streamline the check-in process, reducing congestion at check-in counters. 
            However, it still presents usability challenges, such as slow touchscreen responsiveness, inefficient verification, and difficulites managing the printed tags, receipts, and boarding pass while handling luggage.</p>        </section>
  
        <section id="styles">
          <h2>Style Guide</h2>
          <p>
            Ever wondered how everyone else feels about the checkin kiosks? Well luckily, I observed different users at the airport check-in kiosk so you don't have to!
            <ul>
              <li>My observations showed users with varying emotions based on their familiarity with tech, urgency, and patience. 
              <li>The average time I observed the process taking was between 4-7 minutes. 
                <li>  Younger people found the kiosk efficient but seemed confused between scanning a boarding pass and manually entering a confirmation number, with scanning often being unreliable. 
                  <li> Older adults were frustrated quicker and requested help from the agents.
                    <li>I noticed parents found it difficult to manage luggage, printed documents, and  kids at the same time.
                    <li> Very few users still struggled after being helped by an agent, most people did not have to visit the checkin counter.
        
            </ul>
            Across all observations, scanning issues, lack of multi-passenger check-in efficiency, and touchscreen responsiveness were common usability challenges that impacted the overall experience. Now lets go into the interviews!
          </p>

        <section id="mockup">
          <h2>Mockup</h2>
          <h3>Interview 1</h3>
          <img class="centered-large-image" src="./assets/HS Student.png" alt="High School Student Interview"/>
  
          <h3>Interview 2</h3>
          <img class="centered-large-image" src="./assets/Mother.png" alt="Mother Interview"/>
  
          <h3>Interview 3</h3>
          <img class="centered-large-image" src="./assets/College Student.png" alt="College Student Interview"/>
          <h3>Interview Trends </h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The college and high school students preferred mobile check-in over kiosks. Mobile checkin eliminated manual entry and scanning issues in a rushed airport setting, making it faster and easier than using the kiosk. However they can't check their
                bags in through mobile so they still have to use the kiosk and prefer over waiting in line for the counter since there are more kiosks than desk agents.
              <li> The mother traveling with two kids found it difficult to check in multiple passengers at once, struggled with slow touchscreen responsiveness and small buttons, and expressed wanting a shelf or a designated space to place belongings on the kiosk. 
                <li>While in a rush, printed documents were easy to forget since bag tags, receipts and boarding passes printed separately
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>The Other Side: Airline Kiosk Employees </h3>
          <p>
            Although I couldn't conduct a traditional interview with employees, I gathered their insights on their airline's kiosk usability. They frequently assist frustrated travelers who struggle with slow response times and confusing navigation. They explained that inconsistencies between older and newer kiosk models added to user confusion. Passengers often expect passport scanning and digital payment options like Apple Pay, which aren’t available adding to their agitation. Many also find it frustrating to search for a boarding pass or confirmation number instead of using a passport. Overall, employees observe recurring user frustration due to outdated technology and lack of patience for the machine's responsiveness when passengers are stressed and rushed. </p>

          <h2>Redesign</h2>
          <p> Next stop, I made a persona which is a research-based character that represents a key user type interacting with an interface. By crafting personas, we can step into the user’s world, understanding their frustrations, needs, and behaviors in a realistic way.
            Using an empathy map, I break down what a person thinks, feels, says, and does illustrating user interface experience. This helps developers anticipate user challenges, ensuring interfaces are intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly to improve user experience. 
          I crafted two personas based on my conversations with two key users: a passenger and an employee.</p>

          <h2>Storyboard</h2>
          <p>Second to last stop, let's go talk storyboards! 
            By mapping out a user's experience, storyboards help developers empathize with users and improve interfaces. I created a storyboard based on my observations and interviews with a mother to illustrate the her journey through the check-in kiosk, capturing their interactions, emotions, and challenges..</p>

          <h2>Ready for Takeoff!</h2>
          <p>Now that you've checked in, just drop off your bags, head to TSA, and you're ready to board! We have successfully analyzed the checkin kiosk, despite technical improvements needed in terms of responsiveness and efficiency to reduce confusion. The kiosks defintely reduce airport congestion and wait times, while consistently meeting its goals of checkin, boarding passes and bag tags.</p>
